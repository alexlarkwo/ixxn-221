      <p> I started this weeks tutotial by drafting up some quick wireframes for the inital structure of this blog. </p>

<p> For this weeks tutorial we were also introduced to GitHub.GitHub is a distributed version control system that allows you to maintain the history of your code as you work on your project. This makes it easy to keep track of the changes you make. The ease of this process is emphasized by the branching framework within Git hub. A branch within this system is a new directory where you can work on a certain part of a project without changing the master code. This allows each designer to have their own local repository with a full history of their changes to that code. Therefore,  all members within the group have access to the history of that code and can revisit specific versions of it if need be.
This makes it a great system for groups of designers all working on the same project as it allows an individual to work in an isolated environment and make changes to their copy of the code without impacting the master copy of the code. Making group projects with variations of code easier to organize as well as easier to fix if errors occur.
Pull requests among other things make it easy to keep track of changes as it tells group members what changes you have made to the code. Thus, opening areas for discussion. The code is shared with everyone in the group, making communication and peer review easier. The ease of reviewing the project means that designers can be confident in the work they are releasing. This allows for more frequent releases and with that more customer feedback that can be acted on quickly. Therefore, because git hub creates a streamline development cycle git hub can be a good resource for a group of designers who want to quickly produce a web prototype and get feedback from stakeholders or customers.
